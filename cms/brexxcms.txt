BREXX for CMS (VM/370 and above)
--------------------------------

To compile brexx for CMS, you will need a suitable CMS C
compiler such as GCCCMS.

You then need to transfer all the .c, .h .exec and .txt to the
mainframe. Then run "compile.exec". See zipcms.bat for information
on where all the files are. Note that you need a special config.h.
It is called mvs_config.h and resides in the "mvs" directory. It
needs to be renamed to config.h. zipcms.bat does this.


Note that the batch file "allcms.bat" provides an example of how
the process was automated at one site.


The end result of this process is that a brexx load module
will be created.




Version:

See config.h for the version number
or display it the way compile.exec does.
