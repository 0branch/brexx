Installation for the impatient
==============================

1. Compile the program
	make <os>
   Where os is the os you want to compile e.g
	make linux
   Type make alone to get a list of predefined systems.
   If your system is not there please use the "make custom"
   but modify the make.cnf appropriately

2. Install
	make install

* To create and compile the rpm files modify and run the ./mkrpm

BRexx specific options
======================

  --disable-shared        build shared libraries default=yes
        Disabling the shared libraries will result in a bigger
	executable, 10-30% faster in execution time.
	It will reduce the possibility to extend the code with
	external shared libraries (look the IMPORT function)

  --enable-debug          Build a debugging version.
                          Combine it with the --disable-shared.

  --enable-profile        Include profiling information.

  --disable-removecr      Disable removal of trailing CR from system commands
        Redirected system commands (ie.  dir="pwd"()) by default have
	the ending carriage return stripped

  --disable-align         Disable DWORD align of the bytecode
        Aligning the bytecode is mandatory on RISC architectures, while
	the INTEL CPU's can handle both types. Aligning the bytecode
	results in a compiled rexxcode which executes faster than the
	non-aligned version, while increasing by 50% the memory requirements

  --enable-greek          Enable the GREEK character set

  --enable-mysqlstatic    Enables static support of mysql
        Compile statically the mySQL support instead of a shared library
	which has to be imported with the CALL IMPORT command.

Optional Packages:
  --with-readline         use readline instead of standard input
        Replace the standard input with readline package. Readline
	offers editing on the input line and history.

  --with-mysql=DIR        Sets the mySQL path, default=/usr/lib/mysql
        Set's the mySQL path and compiles the shared library for mySQL
  --without-mysql         To disable the mySQL package
