BREXX for MVS (3.8 and above)
-----------------------------

To compile brexx for MVS, you will need a suitable MVS C
compiler such as GCCMVS.

You then need to transfer all the source code to the
mainframe. zipmvs.bat may be useful for doing this, but the
process of transferring files is beyond the scope of this
document and site-specific.


On the mainframe, modify (according to your site's
requirements), then run, the following bits of JCL:
brexx1.jcl
brexx2.jcl
brexx3.jcl (optional - example only)
brexx4.jcl (optional - example only)
brexx5.jcl
brexx6.jcl
brexx7.jcl

Note that the batch file "allmvs" provides an example of how
the process was automated at one site.


The end result of that process is that a BISON load module
will be created in BISON.LINKLIB.




Version:

See config.h for the version number
or display it the way brexx7.jcl does.

Note - if you wish to use the JCC compiler instead,
use "makejcc" after obvious modifications.
